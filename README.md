### Design Decisions

- Nothing special, can do that if i get more time, you can check my frontend projects, i have designed them all by myself

### Notable Features

- truncated title and product description
- implementation of StarRatingIcon component, included float values even
- displaying only the image on gray background excluding the white background of image using mix-blend-multiply
- used pseudo elements to (grayish) encircle the services icons
- maintainable and modular code
- responsivness across mobile, tablet/laptop, desktop
- error handling, conditional renderings
- shows "category not found" on searching unavailable category
- semantic html, accessiblity considerations, React Hooks for state management
- tried to make everything look like the sample designs

### Areas where i struggled

- it was a simple project, struggled nowhere

### if given more time i would :

- i would implment state management using Redux
- structure the css into user defined class for modularity
